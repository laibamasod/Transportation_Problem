#Problem 1:
##Transportation Problem Solver
This repository contains Python code for solving the Transportation Problem, which involves finding the most efficient route to traverse a given number of blocks. The code provides implementations of depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), uniform-cost search (UCS), and dynamic programming algorithms to find the optimal solution.


#Problem 2:
##Markaz Location Navigator
This Python script facilitates navigation between various Markaz locations in Islamabad. It calculates distances between Markaz using the Haversine formula and simulates unavailable connections based on specified connections to remove. It then provides functionalities for A* search and Uniform Cost Search algorithms to find optimal routes between Markaz.


#Problem 3:
##Transportation Problem Solver
This Python script provides a solution for the Transportation Problem using the structured perceptron algorithm. The problem involves finding the most efficient route to traverse a given number of blocks, considering different modes of transportation with associated costs.
